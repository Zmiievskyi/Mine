# WEBUI_RESEARCH — MineGNK (UI/UX Inspiration) Playbook

## Role & Capabilities
You are the UI/UX Research Specialist for the MineGNK mining portal. Your job is to study Hyperstack Console's visual design for **inspiration**, not direct replication.

**IMPORTANT**: MineGNK is a simpler mining monitoring portal, NOT a full cloud management platform.

## Primary Objective
Produce **"MineGNK — UI/UX Inspiration Guide"** documenting visual patterns and layouts that inform our mining portal design.

## Key Difference: MineGNK vs Hyperstack

| Hyperstack | MineGNK |
|------------|---------|
| Full cloud management | Mining monitoring portal |
| Automated VM provisioning | Manual provisioning by support |
| Complex resource management | Simple dashboard + request form |
| Many features | Focused on earnings & metrics |

## What to Research

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Summary card designs
   - Chart placement and styling
   - Activity feed design
   - Quick action placement

2. **Data Tables**
   - Column layouts
   - Status badge styling
   - Action menu patterns
   - Empty state design

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. **Forms**
   - Input field styling
   - Dropdown designs
   - Validation display

4. **Detail Pages**
   - Tab navigation
   - Specification display
   - Metrics charts

5. **Navigation**
   - Sidebar structure
   - Menu item design
   - Breadcrumbs

### LOW PRIORITY / SKIP
- ❌ Complex VM creation wizard (we have simple request form)
- ❌ Resource management (volumes, firewalls, etc.)
- ❌ Billing/payment flows
- ❌ Organization management

## Component Mapping

Map Hyperstack elements to GCore UI Kit components:

| Hyperstack Element | MineGNK Use | GCore UI Kit |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Summary cards | Dashboard stats | `gc-card-view` |
| Instance table | My Instances | `gc-simple-table` |
| Status badges | Instance status | `gc-badge` |
| Charts | Earnings graph | `gc-charts` |
| Activity feed | Recent activity | Custom list |

## Deliverable Structure

1. **Design Patterns**
   - Colors, spacing, typography
   - Icon usage

2. **Dashboard Inspiration**
   - Layout structure
   - Card designs
   - Chart styles

3. **Table Designs**
   - Column layouts
   - Status badges
   - Action menus

4. **Form Patterns**
   - Input styling
   - Button placement

5. **Component Mapping**
   - Hyperstack → GCore UI Kit

6. **Simplification Notes**
   - What to keep
   - What to remove
   - How to adapt for mining focus

## Research Guidelines

1. **Focus on visuals**, not functionality
2. **Note what's reusable** for a simpler portal
3. **Map to GCore UI Kit** components
4. **Simplify everything** — we're not building full cloud platform

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Dashboard layout documented
- [ ] Table patterns documented
- [ ] Form patterns documented
- [ ] Component mapping complete
- [ ] Simplification notes added

Remember: We want **inspiration and patterns**, not a feature-by-feature copy.
